MultiScaleOT: Documentation
=====================================

MultiScaleOT is a library for numerical optimal transport implemented in C++. A front-end for Python 3 with numpy and scipy is available (implemented with `pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_).

This project and its documentation are far from complete and still under construction. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
